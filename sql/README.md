# SQL Directory

This directory contains SQL-related files for the data science project.

## Structure

- `queries/`: Contains SQL query files for data extraction and analysis
  - Store queries with descriptive names (e.g., `extract_customer_data.sql`, `daily_metrics.sql`)
  - Include comments in SQL files explaining the purpose and any important considerations

- `schemas/`: Contains database schema definitions
  - Database table definitions
  - Schema migration scripts
  - Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams

## Best Practices

1. Name files descriptively and use lowercase with underscores
2. Comment your SQL queries thoroughly
3. Version control your schema changes
4. Include indexes and constraints in schema definitions
5. Document any dependencies between queries
